# meteor-aichain-web3
web3js files used for aichain's wallet project

used in meteor packages like ethereum:web3

This package is a distributed version. We just change the js file directly without compile it.
So need change the json file's content: length and sha1 hash value of js file.

This is not right way to do, we will develop the mobile wallet app to take place of the PC wallet.
